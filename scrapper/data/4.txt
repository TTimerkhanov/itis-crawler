Python Courses: Python Course Self-Study vs. Live Class Lot's of visitors from our website wonder which method of learning Python may be best: studying entirely on one's own with our online tutorial or other textbooks, i.e. "self-study" live classroom trainings or on-site courses We can't provide a general answer to this question. It depends on the goals of a student. One benefit of self-study is that it is the most economical option in terms of money. Although a live class involves expenses, and often requires travelling to the course's location, there are significant and numerous benefits by attending a course taught by a live lecturer in a classroom setting: First of all, it's a lot faster, because our experience is that participants in one of our courses learn in just 3 or 5 days more than they could have learned in weeks of self-study. Moreover, this learning in a classroom setting is fun to learn. Travelling might not even be necessary, if you book Bernd Klein for an on-site course at your institution or company.
