Menu in a Restaurant A menu is a presentation of food and beverage offerings. A menu may be a la carte - which guests use to choose from a list of options - or table d'hôte, in which case a pre-established sequence of courses is served.

Quote of the Day: "Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes." (Edsger Dijkstra) Graphical User Interface A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices in a graphical way, i.e. with images, rather than text commands. Originally interactive user interfaces to computers were not graphical, they were text oriented and usually consisted of commands, which had to be remembered. The DOS operating system from Microsoft and the Bourne shell under Linux are examples of such user-computer interfaces.

Even though the menu of a restaurant and the menu of a computer program have at first glance nothing in common, we can see that yet the have a lot in common. In a restaurant, a menu is a presentation of all their food and beverage offerings, while in a computer application it presents all the commands and functions of the application, which are available to the user via the grafical user interface. Menus in GUIs are presented with a combination of text and symbols to represent the choices. Selecting with the mouse (or finger on touch screens) on one of the symbols or text, an action will be started. Such an action or operation can, for example, be the opening or saving of a file, or the quitting or exiting of an application. A context menu is a menu in which the choices presented to the user are modified according to the current context in which the user is located. We introduce in this chapter of our Python Tkinter tutorial the pull-down menus of Tkinter, i.e. the lists at the top of the windows, which appear (or pull down), if you click on an item like, for example "File", "Edit" or "Help". A Simple Menu Example The following Python script creates a simple application window with menus. from Tkinter import * from tkFileDialog import askopenfilename def NewFile(): print "New File!" def OpenFile(): name = askopenfilename() print name def About(): print "This is a simple example of a menu" root = Tk() menu = Menu(root) root.config(menu=menu) filemenu = Menu(menu) menu.add_cascade(label="File", menu=filemenu) filemenu.add_command(label="New", command=NewFile) filemenu.add_command(label="Open...", command=OpenFile) filemenu.add_separator() filemenu.add_command(label="Exit", command=root.quit) helpmenu = Menu(menu) menu.add_cascade(label="Help", menu=helpmenu) helpmenu.add_command(label="About...", command=About) mainloop() It looks like this, if started: Previous Chapter: Bulls and Cows / Mastermind in TK Next Chapter: Events and Binds © 2011 - 2018, Bernd Klein, Bodenseo; Design by Denise Mitchinson adapted for python-course.eu by Bernd Klein
