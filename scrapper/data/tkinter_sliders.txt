It was broadcast between 1995 and 2000. The series is about a group of travellers which uses a wormhole to "slide" between different parallel universes. Another slider which has nothing to do with Tkinter: The seventh album by the British rock band T. Rex, released in 1972, is called "The Slider". It included the hits "Telegram Sam" and "Metal Guru" This website is created by: Python Training Courses in Toronto, Canada On site trainings in Europe, Canada and the US.

Quote of the Day: "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim." (Edsger Wybe Dijkstra) Graphical User Interface A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices in a graphical way, i.e. with images, rather than text commands. Originally interactive user interfaces to computers were not graphical, they were text oriented and usually consisted of commands, which had to be remembered. The DOS operating system from Microsoft and the Bourne shell under Linux are examples of such user-computer interfaces.

Sliders can be vertically or horizontally arranged. A slider is created with the Scale method(). Using the Scale widget creates a graphical object, which allows the user to select a numerical value by moving a knob along a scale of a range of values. The minimum and maximum values can be set as parameters, as well as the resolution. We can also determine if we want the slider vertically or horizontally positioned. A Scale widget is a good alternative to an Entry widget, if the user is supposed to put in a number from a finite range, i.e. a bounded numerical value. A Simple Example from Tkinter import * master = Tk() w = Scale(master, from_=0, to=42) w.pack() w = Scale(master, from_=0, to=200, orient=HORIZONTAL) w.pack() mainloop() If we start this script, we get a window with a vertical and a horizontal slider: Accessing Slider Values We have demonstrated in the previous example how to create sliders. But it's not enough to have a slider, we also need a method to query it's value. We can accomplish this with the get method. We extend the previous example with a Button to view the values. If this button is pushed, the values of both sliders is printed into the terminal from which we have started the script: from Tkinter import * def show_values(): print (w1.get(), w2.get()) master = Tk() w1 = Scale(master, from_=0, to=42) w1.pack() w2 = Scale(master, from_=0, to=200, orient=HORIZONTAL) w2.pack() Button(master, text='Show', command=show_values).pack() mainloop() Initializing Sliders A slider starts with the minimum value, which is 0 in our examples. There is a way to initialize Sliders with the set(value) method: from Tkinter import * def show_values(): print (w1.get(), w2.get()) master = Tk() w1 = Scale(master, from_=0, to=42) w1.set(19) w1.pack() w2 = Scale(master, from_=0, to=200, orient=HORIZONTAL) w2.set(23) w2.pack() Button(master, text='Show', command=show_values).pack() mainloop() The previous script creates the following window, if it is called: tickinterval and length If the option tickinterval is set to a number, the ticks of the scale will be displayed as multiples of that value. We add a tickinterval to our previous example. from Tkinter import * def show_values(): print (w1.get(), w2.get()) master = Tk() w1 = Scale(master, from_=0, to=42, tickinterval=8) w1.set(19) w1.pack() w2 = Scale(master, from_=0, to=200,tickinterval=10, orient=HORIZONTAL) w2.set(23) w2.pack() Button(master, text='Show', command=show_values).pack() mainloop() If we start this program, we recognize that the vertical slider has the values 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 added to its left side. The horizontal slider has also the numbers 0,10,20, 30, ..., but we can't see them, because the get smeared on top of each other, because the slider is not long enough: To solve this problem we have to increase the length of our horizontal slider. We set the option length. length defines the x dimension, if the scale is horizontal and the y dimension, if the scale is vertical. So we change the definition of w2 in the following way: w2 = Scale(master, from_=0, to=200, length=600,tickinterval=10, orient=HORIZONTAL) The result looks like this: Previous Chapter: Canvas Widgets Next Chapter: Text Widget © 2011 - 2018, Bernd Klein, Bodenseo; Design by Denise Mitchinson adapted for python-course.eu by Bernd Klein
