This also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change." (Fortran manual for Xerox Computers) Definition of a Variable Having the ability or capacity to change or vary. Being capable of alternation in various ways, such as variable seasons or variable winds, e.g. a shifting wind varying in force.

Quote of the Day: A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human. Alan Turing Graphical User Interface A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices in a graphical way, i.e. with images, rather than text commands. Originally interactive user interfaces to computers were not graphical, they were text oriented and usually consisted of commands, which had to be remembered. The DOS operating system from Microsoft and the Bourne shell under Linux are examples of such user-computer interfaces. Data Protection Declaration Data Protection Declaration Previous Chapter: Buttons Next Chapter: Radiobuttons Tkinter Variable Classes Some widgets (like text entry widgets, radio buttons and so on) can be connected directly to application variables by using special options: variable, textvariable, onvalue, offvalue, and value. This connection works both ways: if the variable changes for any reason, the widget it's connected to will be updated to reflect the new value. These Tkinter control variables are used like regular Python variables to keep certain values. It's not possible to hand over a regular Python variable to a widget through a variable or textvariable option. The only kinds of variables for which this works are variables that are subclassed from a class called Variable, defined in the Tkinter module. They are declared like this: x = StringVar() # Holds a string; default value "" x = IntVar() # Holds an integer; default value 0 x = DoubleVar() # Holds a float; default value 0.0 x = BooleanVar() # Holds a boolean, returns 0 for False and 1 for True To read the current value of such a variable, call the method get(). The value of such a variable can be changed with the set() method.
