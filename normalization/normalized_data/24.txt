introduct
when

a
simpl

the
network
scanner
is
one
major
tool
for
analys
which
host
are
avail
on
the
local
network
.
today
there
exist
lot
of
tool
,
but
depend
on
what
you
want
to
do
it
is
a
good
idea
to
write
your
own
analysi
and
penetr
test
tool
.
In
thi
case
we
start
with
a
simpl
network
scanner
,
which
list
the
avail
host
on
your
network
.
To
get
thi
done
there
are
two
(
basic
some
more
but
we
stick
to
the
two
simplest
one
)
possibl
:
icmp

icmp
echo
request
thi
is
well
known
by
use
the
ping
command
.
An
icmp
packet
is
send
to
the
specifi
(
by
IP
address
)
host
and
if
an
icmp
echo
is
receiv
,
it
is
clear
that
the
host
is
onlin

which
mean

In
thi
case
no

it

To
overcom
thi
,
the
tcp
scan
can
help
.
thi
reli
on
the
assumpt
that
host
on
the
network
have
open
port
where
a
client
can
connect
to
(
see
3-way-handshak
)
.
here
we
have
to
guess
port
which
may
be
open
.
thi
is
mainli
dependend
on
the
OS
but
also
on
the
set
.
It
is
like
that
some
port
are
open
but
not
guarante
.
the
follow
port
may
be
open
depend
on
the
oper
system
:

#
appl
io
(
io
is
also
the
name
for
cisco
's
OS
run
on
their
product
)
when
now
write
a
network
scanner
we
can
iter
over
all
the
possibl
IP
address
on
the
network
and
for
everi
IP
we
tri
to
connect
to
one
of
the
port
.
If
the
connect
wa
success
(
ack
receiv
)
we
know
that
thi
host
is
avail
at
the
given
IP
address
.
To
check
wether
a
connect
succe
or
fail
we
can
do
the
follow
in
python
:
import
socket
socket_obj
=
socket.socket
(
socket.af_inet
,
socket.sock_stream
)
socket.setdefaulttimeout
(
1
)
result
=
socket_obj.connect_ex
(
(

)
socket_obj.clos
(
)
socket_obj.connect_ex
(
(

port
)
)
return
0
if
the

otherwis

thi
is
basic
all
the
``

behind
a

the
