In

word
,
you
can
add

to
dictionari
after
they
have
been
defin

as
we
have
seen
in
our
chapter
on
dictionari
.
thi
is
the
reason
,
whi
you
can
dynam
add

that
we
have
creat
so
far
:

the
dictionari
contain
the

``

can

{
'

'dynam

you
might
have
wonder
that
you
can
dynam
add
attribut
to
the
class
,
we
have
defin
so
far
,
but
that
you
ca
n't
do
thi
with
built-in

like
'int

or
'list

a
nice

.
instead

provid
a

which
prohibit
addit
after
the

an
instanc

when
we
design
a
class
,
we
can
use
slot
to
prevent
the
dynam
creation
of
attribut
.
To
defin
slot
,
you
have
to
defin
a
list
with
the
name
__slots__
.
the
list
ha
to
contain
all
the
attribut
,
you
want

We

thi

the

in

the

If
we
start
thi
program
,
we
can
see
,
that
it
is
not

We
