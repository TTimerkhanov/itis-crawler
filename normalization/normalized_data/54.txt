the

is
veri
power

can
be
use
for
a

though
one
of
the

purpos
is
to
provid
simpl

they
are
often

In

it
's
hard

find
a

that
's
whi
we
want
to
start

with
a
such

:
We
creat
a

by
use
the

method
.
We
set
the
height
to

,
i.e
.
two
line
and
the
width
to
30
,
i.e
.
30
charact
.
We
can
appli
the
method
insert
(
)
on
the
object
T
,
which
the
text
(
)
method
had
return
,
to
includ
text

We
add
two

from

the

should

We
add
anoth

the
