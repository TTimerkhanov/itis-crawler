these
were
the
question
which
came
to
our

when
we

ye

there
are

thi

onlin
cours
you
will
find
a
complet
introduct
into
python
in
our
onlin
tutori
:
In
our
first
chapter
you
learn
how
to
use
the
python
interact
interpret
(
in
python3
)
you
will
see
how
easi
it
is
to
execut
a
script
in
python
.
(
in
python3
)
python
differ
from
other
program
languag
in
mani
way
,
but
the
most
strike
one
is
obvious
it
's
``
structur
with
indent
''
(
in
python3
)
variabl
are
easier
to
be
use
than
in
mani
other
program
languag
but
still
there
are
some
thing
to
point
out
about
``
data
type
and
variabl
''
(
in
python3
)
.
though
oper
(
in
python3
)
are
more
or
less
the
same
as
in
other
languag
,
we
have
to
cover
them
anyway
.
assign
can
be
quit
tricki
in
python
.
when
will
an
object
be
copi
and
when
will
we
just
have
a
refer
?
what
's
the
differ
between
a
shallow
and
a
deep
copi
(
in
python3
)
?
condit
statement
(
in
python3
)
are
straightforward
in
python
the
same
is
true
for
the
(
in
python3
)
while
loop
,
but
there
is
thi
special
``
els
''
part
.
the
for
loop
(
in
python3
)
seem
to
be
quit
strang
if
you
are
use
to
C
but
easi
if
you
know
the
bash
shell
the
differ
way
to
format
data
(
onli
in
our
python
3
tutori
)
.
In
thi
chapter
of
our
cours
we
will
have
a
closer
look
at
sequenti
data
type
(
in
python3
)
dictionari
(
in
python3
)
are
one
of
the
best
thing
python
ha
to
offer
It
's
possibl
to
use
set
in
python
program
as
well
:
We
cover
both
set
and
frozenset
(
in
python3
)
program
without
function
(
in
python3
)
would
be
like
cook
without
salt
and
spice
.
and
a
veri
special
spice
for
your
``
cook
''
can
be
a
recurs
function
(
in
python3
)
.
To
understand
function
properli
,
you
need
a
thorough
understand
of
argument
and
paramet
pass
(
in
python3
)
.
In
the
next
chapter
of
our
seminar
you
will
find
all
you
have
to
know
about
namespac
(
in
python3
)
.
further
topic
global
and
local
variabl
(
in
python3
)
is
a
topic
,
which
can
be

A

A
cours
is
not
a
cours
the
question
is
ambigu
.
first
we
want
to
explain
,
whi
thi
websit
is
call
``
A
python
cours
''
.
thi
websit
is
seen
all
over
the
world
and
the
express
``
cours
''
ha
vari
mean
in
the
english
speak
world
.
both
in
the
unit
state
and
canada
,
a
cours
is
a
teach
unit
,
which
might
last
e.g
.
one
academ
term
.
the
student
normal
get
a
grade
or
some
academ
credit
for
attend
the
cours
,
usual
after
have
pass
an
exam
.
In
the
unit
kingdom
and
australia
the
term
``
cours
''
usual
defin
the
complet
programm
of
studi
requir
to
complet
a
major
or
a
studi
path
lead
to
a
univers
degre
.
the
word
``
unit
''
is
use
in
the
UK
to
refer
to
an
academ
cours
in
the
north
american
sens
.
On
the
one
hand
,
we
had
the
US
and
canadian
sens
in
mind
:
our
python
is
one
teach
unit
and
when
you
have
success
pass
it
,
you
are
capabl
of
program
in
python
.
On
the
other
hand
,
we
had
the
origin
mean
of
the
word
in
mind
:
A
``
cours
of
instruct
''
as
it
might
be
use
in
book
titl
like
``
A
cours
in
program
python
''
