prove
to
be

so
nowaday
the

the

of

consist
in
assign

base

the

run
in

mode
:
the

the

.
the

phase
can
be
divid
into
three
kind
:
supervis

is
perform

,
usual
human

,
which
provid
the

for

,
semi-supervis
document
classif
,
a
mixtur
between
supervis

unsupervis
classif
:
some

of

are
label
by
extern

,
unsupervis
document
classif
is
entir
execut
without
refer

.
We
will
implement
a
text

in
python
use
naiv

.
naiv
bay
is
the
most
commonli
use
text
classifi
and
it
is
the
focu
of

A
