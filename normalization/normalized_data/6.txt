a
script
the
interpret
,
an
interact
shell
the
term
'interact
'
and
'shell
'
the
term
``
interact
''
trace
back
to
the
latin
express
``
inter
ager
''
.
the
verb
``
ager
''
mean
amongst
other
thing
``
to
do
someth
''
and
``
to
act
''
,
while
``
inter
''
denot
the
spatial
and
tempor
posit
to
thing
and
event
,
i.e
.
``
between
''
or
``
among
''
object
,
person
,
and
event
.
So
``
inter
ager
''
mean
``
to
act
between
''
or
``
to
act
among
''
these
.
with
thi
in
mind
,
we
can
say
that
the
interact
shell
is
between
the
user
and
the
oper
system
(
e.g
.
linux
,
unix
,
window
or
other
)
.
instead
of
an
oper
system
an
interpret
can
be
use
for
a
program
languag
like
python
as
well
.
the
python
interpret
can
be
use
from
an
interact
shell
.
the
interact
shell
is
also
interact
in
the
way
that
it
stand
between
the
command
or
action
and
their
execut
.
thi
mean
the
shell
wait
for
command
from
the
user
,
which
it
execut
and
return
the
result
of
the
execut
.
after
thi
the
shell
wait
for
the
next
input
.
A
shell
in
biolog
is
a
calcium
carbon
``
wall
''
which
protect
snail
or
mussel
from
it
environ
or
it
enemi
.
similarli
,
a
shell
in
oper
system
lie
between
the
kernel
of
the
oper
system
and
the
user
.
It
's
a
``
protect

in
both
direct
.
the
user
doe
n't
have
to
use
the
complic
basic
function
of
the
OS
but
is
capabl
of

simpl

easier
to

shell
command
.
the

is

python

comfort
command
line
interfac
with
the
python
shell
,
which
is
also
known
as
the
``
python
interact

''
.
It
look
like
the
term
``
interact
shell
''
is
a
tautolog
,
becaus
``

is

In

not

the

how
to
quit
the
python
shell
So
,
we
have
just
start
,
and
we
alreadi
talk
about
quit
the
shell
.
We
do
thi
,
becaus
we
know
,
how
annoy
it
can
be
,
if
you
do
n't
know
how
to
properli
quit
a
program
.
It
's
easi
to
end
the
interact
session
:
you
can
either
use
exit
(
)
or
ctrl-d
(
i.e
.
eof
)
to
exit
.
the
bracket
behind
the
exit
function
are
crucial
.
(

python
follow
the
usual
order

the
