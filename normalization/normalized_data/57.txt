introduct
A
slider
is
a
tkinter
object
with
which
a
user
can
set
a
valu
by
move
an
indic
.
slider
can
be
vertic
or
horizont
arrang
.
A
slider
is
creat
with
the
scale
method
(
)
.
use
the
scale
widget
creat
a
graphic
object
,
which
allow
the
user
to
select
a
numer
valu
by
move
a
knob
along
a
scale
of
a
rang
of
valu
.
the
minimum
and
maximum
valu
can
be
set
as
paramet
,
as
well
as
the
resolut
.
We
can
also
determin
if
we
want
the
slider
vertic
or
horizont
posit
.
A
scale
widget
is
a
good
altern
to
an
entri
widget
,
if
the
user
is
suppos
to
put
in
a
number
from
a
finit
rang
,
i.e
.
a
bound
numer
valu
.
A
simpl
exampl
from
tkinter
import
*
master
=
Tk
(
)
w
=
scale
(
master
,
from_=0
,
to=42
)
w.pack
(
)
w
=
scale
(
master
,
from_=0
,
to=200
,
orient=horizont
)
w.pack
(
)
mainloop
(
)
If
we
start
thi
script
,
we
get
a
window
with
a
vertic
and
a
horizont
slider
:
access
slider
valu
We
have
demonstr
in
the
previou
exampl
how
to
creat
slider
.
but
it
's
not
enough
to
have
a
slider
,
we
also
need
a
method
to
queri
it
's
valu
.
We
can
accomplish
thi
with
the
get
method
.
We
extend
the
previou
exampl
with
a
button
to
view
the
valu
.
If
thi
button
is
push
,
the
valu
of
both
slider
is
print
into
the
termin
from
which
we
have
start
the
script
:
from
tkinter
import
*
def
show_valu
(
)
:
print
(
w1.get
(
)
,
w2.get
(
)
)
master

w1

scale

from_=0

)
w1.pack

w2

,

)
w2.pack

initi
slider
A
slider
start
with
the
minimum
valu
,
which
is
0
in
our
exampl
.
there
is
a
way
to
initi
slider
with
the
set
(
valu
)
method
:
from
tkinter
import
*
def
show_valu
(
)
:
print
(
w1.get
(
)
,
w2.get
(
)
)
master
=
Tk
(
)
w1
=
scale
(
master
,
from_=0
,
to=42
)
w1.set
(
19
)
w1.pack
(
)
w2
=
scale
(
master
,
from_=0
,
to=200
,
orient=horizont
)
w2.set
(
23
)
w2.pack
(
)
button
(
master
,
text='show
'
,
command=show_valu
)
.pack
(
)
mainloop
(
)
the
previou
script
creat
the
follow
window
,
if
it
is
call
:
tickinterv
and
length
If
the
option
tickinterv
is
set
to
a
number
,
the
tick
of
the
scale
will
be
display
as
multipl
of
that
valu
.
We
add
a
tickinterv
to
our
previou
exampl
.
from
tkinter
import
*
def
show_valu
(
)
:
print
(
w1.get
(
)
,
w2.get
(
)
)
master
=
Tk
(
)
w1
=
scale
(
master
,
from_=0
,
to=42
,
tickinterval=8
)
w1.set
(
19
)
w1.pack
(
)
w2
=
scale
(
master
,
from_=0
,
to=200
,
tickinterval=10
,
orient=horizont
)
w2.set
(
23
)
w2.pack
(
)
button
(
master
,
text='show
'
,
command=show_valu
)
.pack
(
)
mainloop
(
)
If
we
start
thi
program
,
we
recogn
that
the
vertic
slider
ha
the
valu
0
,
8
,
16
,
24
,
32
,
40
ad
to
it
left
side
.
the
horizont
slider
ha
also
the
number
0,10,20
,
30
,
...
,
but
we
ca
n't
see
them
,
becaus
the
get
smear
on
top
of
each
other
,
becaus
the
slider
is
not
long
enough
:
To
solv
thi
problem
we
have
to
increas
the
length
of
our
horizont
slider
.
We
set
the
option
length
.
length
defin
the
x
dimens
,
if
the
scale
is
horizont
and
the
y
dimens
,
if
the
scale
is
vertic
.
So
we
chang
the
definit
of
w2
in
the
follow
way
:
w2
=
scale
(
master
,
from_=0
,
to=200
,
length=600
,
tickinterval=10
,
orient=horizont
)
the
result
look
like
