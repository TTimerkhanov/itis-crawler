As
we
have

,
a

inherit
in
thi
case
from

multipl
inherit
on
the
other
hand
is
a
featur
in
which
a
class
can
inherit
attribut
and
method
from
more
than
one
parent
class
.
the
critic
point
out
that
multipl
inherit
come
along
with
a
high
level
of
complex
and
ambigu
in
situat
such
as
the
diamond

.
We
will
address
thi
problem
later
in

We
want
to
introduc
the
principl
of
multipl

with
an

for
thi
purpos

we
will

a

after

we

contain

is
store
in

princip
,
we
could
have
written
the

the

thi

we

the
rule
for
calcul

are
the
follow
:
If
a

it
is
a
leap
year
.
If
a

is
not

by
100

it
is
not
a

.
A
year
number
which
is
divis
by
4
but
not
by
100
,
it
is
a
leap

.
all

are

how
can
we

if
both

have
to
call

In
thi
case

we
have
to
take
away
the
call

in

the
code
might
look

thi

there
is

lurk

the

the

which
is
the

,
consist
in

We
demonstr
the

a.__init__
the
question
aris
how
the
super
function
make
it
decis
.
how
doe
it
decid
which
class
ha
to
be
use
?
As
we
have
alreadi
mention
,
it
use
the
so-cal
method
resolut
order
(
mro
)
.
It
is
base
on
the
``
C3
superclass
linearis
''
algorithm
.
thi
is
call
a
linearis
,
becaus
the
tree
structur
is
broken
down
into
a
linear
order
.
the
mro
method
can
be
use
to
creat
thi
list
:
>

from
super_init

polymorph
polymorph
is
constru
from
two
greek
word
.
``
poli
''
stand
for
``
much
''
or
``
mani
''
and
``
morph
''
mean
shape
or
form
.
polymorph
is
the
state
or
condit
of
be
polymorph
,
or
if
we
use
the
translat
of
the
compon
``
the
abil
to
be
in
mani
shape
or
form
.
polymorph
is
a
term
use
in
mani
scientif
area
.
In
crystallographi
it
defin
the
state
,
if
someth
crystal
into
two
or
more
chemic
ident
but
crystallograph
distinct
form
.
biologist
know
polymorph
as
the
exist
of
an
organ
in
sever
form
or
colour
varieti
.
the
roman
even
had
a
god
,
call
morpheu
,
who
is
abl
to
take
ani
human
form
:
morheu
appear
in
ovid
's
metamorphos
and
is
the
son
of
somnu
,
the
god
of
sleep
.
you
can
admir
morpheu
and
iri
in
the
pictur
on
the
right
side
.
So
,
befor
we
fall
to
sleep
,
we
get
back
to
python
and
to
what
polymorph
mean
in
the
program
languag
context
.
polymorph
in
comput
scienc
is
the
abil
to
present
the
same
interfac
for
differ
underli
form
.
We
can
have
in
some
program
languag
polymorph
function
or
method
,
for
exampl
.
polymorph
function
or
method
can
be
appli
to
argument
of
differ
type
,
and
they
can
behav
differ
depend
on
the
type
of
the
argument
to
which
they
are
appli
.
We
can
also
defin
the
same
function
name
with
a
vari
number
of
paramet
.
let
's
have
a
look
at
the
follow
python
function
:
def
f
(
x
,
y
)
:
print
(
``
valu
:
``
,
x
,
y
)
f
(
42
,
43
)
f
(
42
,
43.7
)
f
(
42.3
,
43
)
f
(
42.0
,
43.9
)
We
can
call
thi
function
with
variou
type
,
as
demonstr
in
the
exampl
.
In
type
program
languag
like
java
or
c++
,
we
would
have
to
overload
f
to
implement
the
variou
type
combin
.
our
exampl
could
be
implement
like
thi
in
c++
:
#
includ
<
iostream
>
use
namespac
std
;
void
f
(
int
x
,
int
y
)
{
cout
<
<
``
valu
:
``
<
<
x
<
<
``
,
``
<
<
x
<
<
endl
;
}
void
f
(
int
x
,
doubl
y
)
{
cout
<
<
``
valu
:
``
<
<
x
<
<
``
,
``
<
<
x
<
<
endl
;
}
void
f
(
doubl
x
,
int
y
)
{
cout
<
<
``
valu
:
``
<
<
x
<
<
``
,
``
<
<
x
<
<
endl
;
}
void
f
(
doubl
x
,
doubl
y
)
{
cout
<
<
``
valu
:
``
<
<
x
<
<
``
,
``
<
<
x
<
<
endl
;
}
int
main
(
)
{
f
(
42
,
43
)
;
f
(
42
,
43.7
)
;
f
(
42.3,43
)
;
f
(
42.0
,
43.9
)
;
}
python
is
implicitli
polymorph
.
We
can
appli
our
previous
defin
function
f
even
to
list
,
string
or
other
type
,
which
can
be
print
:
