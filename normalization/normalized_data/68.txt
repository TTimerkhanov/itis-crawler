now
we
will
calcul
the
mean
valu
again
,
but
thi
time
on
the
datafram
'cleansed_df
'
,
i.e
.
where
we
have
taken
out
all
the
row
,
where
more
than
one
nan
valu
occur
.
average_temp_seri
=
cleansed_df.mean
(
axis=1
)
sensor
=
cleansed_df.columns.valu
df
=
cleansed_df.drop
(
sensor
,
axis=1
)
#
best
practic
:
df
=
df.assign
(
temperature=average_temp_seri
)
#
inplac
option
not
avail
df
[
:6
]
the
abov
python
code
return
the
follow
output
:
