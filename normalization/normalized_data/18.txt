(
august
2014
)
the
pictur
on
the
right
side
is
mislead
:
We
are
not
talk
about
thi
kind
of
pylon
,
i.e

electr
pylon
,
or
transmiss
tower
,
use
to
support
an
overhead
power
line
.
but
their
is
some
interest
aspect
in
thi
comparison
.
It
is
a
set
of
web
applic
framework
written
in
python
.
So
it
can
be
seen
as
the
steel
lattic
tower
of
an
electr
pylon
,
but
it
is
not
support
power
line
but
web
page
.
jame

We

start
with

how
to

you

If

all
you
have
to
do
is
execut
the
follow
code
on
a

you
are
abl
to
creat
your

:

you

If

We

If
we
visit
the
url
http

//localhost:5000/hello/index
we
will
get
a
websit
with
the
content
``
hello

:
We
want
to
chang
our
applic
into
a
multilingu
websit
,
i.e
.
visitor
should
be
greet
in
their
languag
.
To
thi
purpos
we
will
have
to
chang
the
file
hello.pi
,
which
can
be
found
in
myproject/myproject/controllers/
:
import

#
or
,
return

We
will
chang
the

of
the

:

:
#
return

return

call
the
url
``
http
:

''
will
still
return
``
hello

''
,
but
ad
``

-
i.e
.
http
:
//localhost:5000/hello/index/d
-
to
the
previou
url
will
return

hallo

''
.
mako
templat
you
may
have
notic
the
comment
line
``
#
return

)
''
.
If
we
uncom
thi
line
,
the
server
will
use
a
mako
templat
``
hello.mako
''
or
better
it
will
tri
to
use
a
templat
.
thi
templat
is
suppos
to
be
locat
in
the
directori
``
myproject/templates/
''
.
So
far
thi
directori
is
empti
.
uncom
the

will

A
mako
is
a
templat
librari
-
also
call
a

written
in

It
is
the
default

api
borrow
from
other
approach
,
e.g
.
django
,
jinja2
,
myghti
,
and
genshi
.
mako
is
an
embed
python
languag
,
use
for
python
server
page
.
A
mako
templat
contain
variou
kind
of
content
,
for
exampl
,
xml
,
html
,
email
text
,
and
so
on
.
A

can
contain

express

,
control

,
or
block
of
python

It
may
also
contain

A
mako
is
compil
into
real
python
code
.
the
easiest
possibl
mako
templat
consist
sole
of
html
code
.
the
follow
mako

is

/h1

<
p
>
hello

!
<
/p

<
/bodi

<

We
chang
our
hello.pi
in
the
directori
``
control
''
to
the
follow
code
:
from
myproject.lib.bas
import
basecontrol
,
render
class
hellocontrol
(
basecontrol
)
:
def
index
(
self
,
id=non
)
:
#
return
a
render
templat
return
render
(
'/hello.mako
'
)
We
have
to
save
it
in
the
templat
subdirectori
.
the
new
page
look
like
thi
on
a
chromium
browser
:
thi
introduct
is
about
dynam
web
page
with
pylon
,
so
we
have
to
person
our
greet
.
At
first
,
we
want
to
demonstr
how
to
use
python
variabl
insid
of
a
templat
.
To
thi
purpos
,
the
tmpl_context
is
avail
in
the
pylon
modul
,
and
refer
to
the
templat
context
.
object
attach
to
it
are
avail
in
the
templat
namespac
as
tmpl_context
.
In
most
case
tmpl_context
is
alias
as
c
in
control
and
templat
for
conveni
.
our
hello.pi
need
to
import
tmpl_context
and
we
set
c.name
to
``
frank
''
:
from
pylon
import
tmpl_context
as
c
from
myproject.lib.bas
import
basecontrol
,
render
class
hellocontrol
(
basecontrol
)
:
def
index
(
self
,
id=non
)
:
c.name
=
``
frank
''
#
return
a
render
templat
return
render
(
'/hello.mako
'
)
the
output
in
a
broser
ha
n't
chang
dramat
.
just
``
hello
frank
''
instead
of
``
hello
my
friend
!
''
.
admittedli
,
still
not
veri
dynam
!
but
we
can
use
the
url
with
our
id
paramet
again
:
from
pylon
import
tmpl_context
as
c
from
myproject.lib.bas
import
basecontrol
,
render
class
hellocontrol
(
basecontrol
)
:
def
index
(
self
,
id=non
)
:
c.name
=
id
if
id
els
``
my
friend
''
#
return
a
render
templat
return
render
(
'/hello.mako
'
)
visit
http
:
//localhost:5000/hello/index/frank
render
the
output
``
hello
frank
!
``
,
wherea
the
url
http
:
//localhost:5000/hello/index
will
produc
``
hello
my
friend
!
''
map
the
root
url
We
have
seen
that
we
can
put
variou
static
html
file
under
the
root
directori
``
myproject/public/index.html
''
of
our
project
.
We
saw
that
index.html
of
the
public
directori
is
the
own
which
is
shown
,
if
we
point
the
browser
to
http
:
//localhost:5000/
you
may
want
to
have
a
dynam
page
right
at
the
root
.
So
,
we
have
to
map
the
root
url
http
:
//localhost:5000/
to
a
control
action
.
thi
can
be
done
by
modifi
the
routing.pi
file
in
the
config
directori
.
If
you
look
at
thi
file
,
you
will
find
a
comment
line
``
#
custom
rout
here
''
.
you
have
to
add
the
follow
line
after
thi
line
:
#
custom
rout
here
map.connect
(
'/
'
,
controller='hello
'
,
action='index
'
)
there
is
one
more
thing
you
should
n't
forget
:
you
have
to
remov
the
index.html
file
in
public
.
otherwis
thi
file
will
be
still
serv
