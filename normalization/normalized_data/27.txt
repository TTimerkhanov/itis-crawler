you

they

we

how

all

is
to

principi
,
we
could
have
written
c.counter
instead
of
type
(
self
)
.counter
,
becaus
type
(
self
)
will
be
evalu
to
``
C
''
anyway
.
but
we
will
see
later
,
that
type
(
self

make
sens
,
if
we
use
such
a
class
as
a
superclass
.
If
we
start
the
previou
program
,
we
will
get
the
follow
result
:

static
method
We
use
class
attribut
as
public
attribut
in
the
previou
section
.
Of
cours
,
we
can
make
public
attribut
privat
as
well
.
We
can
do
thi
by
ad
the
doubl
underscor
again
.
If
we
do
so
,
we
need
a
possibl
to
access
and
chang
these
privat
class
attribut
.
We
could
use
instanc
method
for
thi
purpos
:
class
robot
:
__counter
=
0
def
__init__
(
self
)
:
type

.__counter
+=

if

''
:
x
=
robot
(
)
print
(
x.robotinst
(
)
)
y
=
robot
(
)
print
(
x.robotinst
(
)
)
thi
is
not
a
good
idea
for
two
reason
:
first
of
all
,
becaus
the
number
of
robot
ha
noth
to
do
with
a
singl
robot
instanc
and
secondli
becaus
we
ca
n't
inquir
the
number
of
robot
befor
we
have
n't
creat
an
instanc
.
If
we
tri
to
invok
the
method
with
the
class
name
robot.robotinst
(
)
,
we
get
an
error
messag
,
becaus
it
need
an
instanc
as
an
argument
:
>

(

recent
call

,
in
<

>
typeerror
:

take
exactli
1
argument
(
0
given
)
the
next
idea
,
which
still
doe
n't
solv
our
problem
,
consist
in
omit
the
paramet
``
self
''
:
class
robot
:
__counter
=
0
def
__init__
(
self
)
:
type
(
self
)
.__counter
+=
1
def
robotinst
(
)
:
return
robot.__count
now
it
's
possibl
to
access
the
method
via
the
class
name
,
but
we
ca
n't
call
it
via
an
instanc
:
>

the
call
``
x.robotinst
(
)
''
is
treat
as
an
instanc
method
call
and
an
instanc
method
need
a
refer
to
the
instanc
as
the
first
paramet
.
So
,
what
do
we
want
?
We
want
a
method
,
which
we
can
call
via
the
class
name
or
via
the
instanc
name
without
the
necess
of
pass
a
refer
to
an
instanc
to
it
.
the
solut
consist
in
static
method
,
which
do
n't
need
a
refer
to
an
instanc
.
It
's
easi
to
turn
a
method
into
a
static
method
.
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
add
a
line
with
``
@
staticmethod
''
directli
in
front
of
the
method
header
.
It
's
the
decor
syntax
.
you
can
see
in
the
follow
exampl
that
we
can
now
use
our
method
robotinst
the
way
we
want
:
class
robot
:
__counter
=
0
def
__init__
(
self
)
:
type
(
self
)
.__counter
+=
1
@
staticmethod
def
robotinst
(
)
:
return
robot.__count
if
__name__
==
``
__main__
''
:
print
(
robot.robotinst
(
)
)
x
=
robot
(

print
(
x.robotinst

)
y
=
robot
(
)
print
(
x.robotinst

the

is
a

i.e

the
use

of

method
:
the
are
use
in
the
definit
of
the
so-cal
factori
method
,
which
we
will
not
cover
here
.
they
are
often
use
,
where
we
have
static
method
,
which
have
to
call
other
static
method
.
To
do
thi
,
we
would
have
to
hard
code
the
class
name
,
if
we
had
to
use
static
method
.
thi
is
a
problem
,
if
we
are
in
a
use
case
,
where
we
have
inherit
class
.
the
follow
program
contain
a
fraction
class
,
which
is
still
not
complet
.
If
you
work
with
fraction
,
you
need
to
be
capabl
of
reduc
fraction
,
e.g
.
the
fraction
8/24
can
be
reduc
to
1/3
.
We
can
reduc
a
fraction
to
lowest
term
by
divid
both
the
numer
and
denomin
by
the
greatest
common
divisor
(
gcd
)
.
We
have
defin
a
static
gcd
function
to
calcul
the
greatest
common
divisor
of
two
number
.
the
greatest
common
divisor
(
gcd
)
of
two
or
more
integ
(
at
least
one
of
which
is
not
zero
)
,
is
the
largest
posit
integ
that
divid
the
number
without
a
remaind
.
for
exampl
,
the
'gcd
of
8
and
24
is
8
.
the

``

our

method
``

with
``

``

We
will
demonstr
in
our
last
exampl
the
use
of
class
method
in
inherit
.
We
defin
a
class
``
pet
''
with
a
method
``
about
''
.
thi
class
will
be
inherit
in
a
subclass
``
dog
''
and
``
cat
''
.
the
method
``
about
''
will
be
inherit
as
well
.
We
will
defin
the
method
``
about
''
as
a
``
staticmethod
''
in
our
first
implement
to
show
the
disadvantag
of
thi
approach
:
class
pet
:
name
=
``
pet
anim
''
@
staticmethod
def
about
(
)
:
print
(
``
thi
class
is
about
{
}
!
``
.format
(
pets.nam
)
)
class
dog
(
pet
)
:
name
=
``
'man
's
best
friend
'
(
frederick
II
)
''
class
cat
(
pet
)
:
name
=
``
cat
''
p
=
pet
(
)
p.about
(
)
d
=
dog
(
)
d.about
(
)
c
=
cat
(
)
c.about
(
)
We
get
the
follow
output
:
thi
class
is
about
pet
anim
!
thi
class
is
about
pet
anim
!
thi
class
is
about
pet
anim
!
especi
,
in
the
case
of
c.about
(
)
and
d.about
(
)
,
we
would
have
prefer
a
more
specif
phrase
!
the
``
problem
''
is
that
the
method
``
about
''
doe
n't
know
that
it
ha
been
call
by
an
instanc
of
the
dog
or
cat
class
.
We
decor
it
now
with
a
classmethod
decor
instead
of
a
staticmethod
decor
:
class
pet
:
name
=
``
pet
anim
''
@
classmethod
def
about
(
cl
)
:
print
(
``
thi
class
is
about
{
}
!
``
.format
(
cls.name
)
)
class
dog
(
pet
)
:
name
=
``
'man
's
best
friend
'
(
frederick
II
)
''
class
cat
(
pet
)
:
name
=
``
cat
''
p
=
pet
(
)
p.about
(
)
d
=
dog
(
)
d.about
(
)
c
=
cat
(
)
c.about
(
)
the
output
is
now
like
we
want
it
to
be
:
thi
class
is
about
pet
anim
!
thi
class
is
about
'man
's
best
friend
'
(
frederick
II
)
!
thi
class
is
about
cat
!
