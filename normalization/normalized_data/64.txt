exampl
with

We
write
an
applic
,
which
depict
a
list
of
program
languag
,
e.g
.
[
'python
'
,
'rubi
'
,
'perl

,
'

]
and
a
list
of
natur
languag
,
e.g
.
[
'english
'
,
'german
'
]
as
checkbox
.
So
it
's
possibl
to
choos
program
languag
and
natur
languag
.
furthermor
,
we
have
two
button
:
A
``

button
for
end
the
applic
and
a
``

button
for
