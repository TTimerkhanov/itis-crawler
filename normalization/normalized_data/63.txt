they
hope
that
someon
get
their

tkinter
messag
widget
the
widget
can
be
use
to
display
short
text
messag
.
the
messag
widget
is
similar
in
it
function
to
the
label
widget
,
but
it
is
more
flexibl
in
display
text
,
e.g
.
the
font
can
be
chang
while
the
label
widget
can
onli
display
text
in
a
singl
font
.
It
provid
a
multilin
object
,
that
is
the
text
may
span
more
than
one
line
.
the
text
is
automat
broken
into
line
and
justifi
.
We
were
ambigu
,
when
we
said
,
that
the
font
of
the
messag
widget
can
be
chang
.
thi
mean
that
we
can
choos
arbitrarili
a
font
for
one
widget
,
but
the
text
of
thi
widget
will
be
render
sole
in
thi
font
.
thi
mean
that
we
ca
n't
chang
the
font
within
a
widget
.
So
it
's
not
possibl
to
have
a
text
in
more
than
one
font
.
If
you
need
to
display
text
in
multipl
font
,
we
suggest
to
use
a
text
widget
.
the
syntax
of
a
messag
widget
:
