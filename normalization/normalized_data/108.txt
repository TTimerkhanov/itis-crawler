thi

you
will
learn
how
to

to

and
you
will
also
learn
how
to
delet
and
remov

by

'remov

and
'pop

A
list
can
be
seen
as
a
stack
.
A
stack
in
comput
scienc
is
a
data
structur
,
which
ha
at
least
two
oper
:
one
which
can
be
use
to
put
or
push
data
on
the
stack
and
anoth
one
to
take
away
the
most
upper
element
of
the
stack
.
the
way
of
work
can
be
imagin
with
a
stack
of
plate
.
If
you
need
a
plate
you
will
usual
take
the
most
upper
one
.
the
use
plate
will
be
put
back
on
the
top
of
the
stack
after
clean
.
If
a
program
languag
support
a
stack
like
data
structur
,
it
will
also
suppli
at
least
two
oper
:

method
is
use
to
put

we
say
that
we
``

python
doe

the

the

will
be

which
can
be

to

.
the
python
list
class
doe
n't
possess
such
a
method
,
becaus
it

We
saw
that
it
is
easi
to
append
an
object
to
a
list
.
but
what
about
ad
more
than
one
element
to
a
list
?
mayb
,
you
want
to
add
all
the
element
of
anoth
list
to
your
list
.
If
you
use
append
,
the
other
list
will
be
append
as
a
sublist
,
as
we
can
see
in
the
follow
exampl
:

42,98,77

what
we
want
to
accomplish
is
the
follow
:
[
42
,
98
,
77
,
8
,
69
]
To
thi
purpos
,
python
provid
the
method
'extend
'
.
It
extend
a
list
by
append
all
the
element
of
an
iter
like
a
list
,
a
tupl
or
a
string
to
a
list
:
>

As
we
have
mention
,
the
argument
of
extend
doe
n't
have
to
be
a
list
.
It
can
be
ani
iter

thi
mean
that
we
can

We
will
compar
in
the

the

calcul
their

To
understand
the

program
,
you
need
to
know

We
can
see
that
the
``
+
''
oper
is
about
1268
slower
than
the
append
method
.
the
explan
is
easi
:
If
we
use
the
append
method
,
we
will
simpli
append
a
further
element
to
the
list
in
each
loop
pass
.
now
we
come
to
the
first
loop
,
in
which
we
use
l
=
l
+
[
i
*
2
]
.
the
list
will
be
copi
in
everi
loop
pass
.
the
new
element
will
be
ad
to
the
copi
of
the
list
and
result
will
be
reassign
to
the
variabl
l.
after
thi
the
old
list
will
have
to
be
remov
by
python
,
becaus
it
is
not
referenc
anymor
.
We
can
also
see
that
the
version
with
the
augment
assign
(
``

''
)
,
the
loop
in
the
middl
,
is
onli
slightli
slower
than
the
version
use
``
append
''
.
remov
an
element
with
remov
It
is
possibl
to
remov
with
the
method
``
remov
''
a
certain
valu
from
a
list
without
know
the
posit
.
s.remov

We

As
