thi
chapter
of
our
tutori
deal
with
histogram
.
It
's
hard
to
imagin
that
you
open
a
newspap
or
magazin
without
see
some
histogram
tell
you
about
the
number
of
smoker
in
certain
age
group
,
the
number
of
birth
per
year
and
so
on
.
It
's
a
great
way
to
depict
fact
without
have
to
use
too
mani
word
,
but
on
the
downsid
they
can
be
use
to
manipul
or
lie

''
as
well
.
what
is
a
histogram
?
A
formal
definit
can
be
:
It
's
a
graphic
represent
of
a
frequenc
distribut
of
some
numer
data
.
rectangl
with
equal
size
in
the
horizont
direct
have
height
with
the
correspond
frequenc
.
If
we
construct
a
histogram
,
we
start
with
distribut
the
rang
of
possibl
x
valu
into
usual
equal
size
and
adjac
interv
or
bin
.
We
start
now
with
a
practic
python
program
.
We
creat
a
histogram
with
random

let
's
increas
the
number
of
bin
.
10
bin
is
not
a
lot
,
if
you
imagin
,
that
we
have
10,000
random
valu
.
To
do
so
,
we
set
the
keyword
paramet
bin
to
100
:
plt.hist
(
gaussian_numb
,
bins=100
)
plt.show
(
)
anoth
import
keyword
paramet
of
hist
is
``
norm
''
.
``
norm
''
is
option
and
the
default
valu
is
'fals
'
.
If
it
is
set
to
'true
'
,
the
first
element
of
the
return
tupl
will
be
the
count
normal
to
form
a
probabl
densiti
,
i.e.
,
``
n/
(
len
(
x
)
`
dbin
)
''
,
ie
the
integr
of
the
histogram
will
sum
to
1.
plt.hist
(
gaussian_numb
,
bins=100
,
normed=tru
)
plt.show
(
)
If
both
the
paramet
'norm
'
and
'stack
'
are
set
to
'true
'
,
the
sum
of
the
histogram
is
normal
to
1.
plt.hist

okay
,
you
want
to
see
it

depict

We
can
plot
it
as

as
well
