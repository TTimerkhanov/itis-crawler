error
and
except
except
handl
An
except
is
an
error
that
happen
dure
the
execut
of
a
program
.
except
are
known
to
non-programm
as
instanc
that
do
not
conform
to
a
gener
rule
.
the
name
``
except
''
in
comput
scienc
ha
thi
mean
as
well
:
It
impli
that
the
problem
(
the
except
)
doe
n't
occur
frequent
,
i.e
.
the
except
is
the
``
except
to
the
rule
''
.
except
handl
is
a
construct
in
some
program
languag
to
handl
or
deal
with
error
automat
.
mani
program
languag
like
c++
,
objective-c
,
php
,
java
,
rubi
,
python
,
and
mani
other
have
built-in
support
for
except
handl
.
error
handl
is
gener
resolv
by
save
the
state
of
execut
at
the
moment
the
error
occur
and
interrupt
the
normal
flow
of
the
program
to
execut
a
special
function
or
piec
of
code
,
which
is
known
as
the
except
handler
.
depend
on
the
kind
of
error
(
``
divis
by
zero
''
,
``
file
open
error
''
and
so
on
)
which
had
occur
,
the
error
handler
can
``
fix
''
the
problem
and
the
programm
can
be
continu
afterward
with
the
previous
save
data
.
except
handl
in
python
except
handl
in
python
is
veri
similar
to
java
.
the
code
,
which
harbour
the
risk
of
an
except
,
is
embed
in
a
tri
block
.
but
wherea
in
java
except
are
caught
by
catch
claus
,
we
have
statement
introduc
by
an
``
except
''
keyword
in
python
.
It
's
possibl
to
creat
``
custom-mad
''
except
:
with
the
rais
statement
it
's
possibl
to
forc
a
specifi
except
to
occur
.
let
's
look
at
a
simpl
exampl
.
assum
we
want
to
ask
the
user
to
enter
an
integ
number
.
If
we
use
a
input
(
)
,
the
input
will
be
a
string
,
which
we
have
to
cast
into
an
integ
.
If
the
input
ha
not
been
a
valid
integ
,
we
will
gener
(
rais
)
a
valueerror
.
We
show
thi
in
the
follow
interact
session
:

n

(
``

valueerror

for
int
(
)
with
base
10
:
'23.5
'
with
the
aid
of
except
handl
,
we
can
write
robust
code
for
read
an
integ
from
input
:
while
true
:
tri
:
n
=
input
(
``
pleas

)
n

break

pleas

...
''
)
print
(
``
great
,

success

''
)
It
's
a
loop
,
which
break
onli
,
if
a
valid
integ
ha
been
given
.
the
exampl
script
work
like
thi
:
the
while
loop
is
enter

the
code
within
the
tri

will
be
execut
statement

.
If
no
except
occur
dure
the
execut
,
the
execut
will
reach
the
break
statement
and
the
while
loop
will
be
left
.
If
an
except
occur
,
i.e
.
in
the
cast
of
n
,
the
rest
of
the
tri
block
will
be
skip
and
the
except
claus
will
be
execut
.
the
rais
error
,
in
our
case
a
valueerror
,
ha
to
match
one

the

after

.
In
our
exampl
onli
one
,
i.e
.
``
valueerror

.
after
have
print
the
text
of
the
print
statement
,
the
execut
doe
anoth
loop
.
It
start
with
a
new
input
(

.
An
exampl
usag
could
look
like
thi
:

have
more

but
at

our
next

show
a

in

we
open

read

If

An

We

learn
from

that
the

catch
the

invalid

We
will
extend
our
exampl
now
so
that
the

catch

We
add
now

so
that

the
follow
exampl
open
a
file
and
read
in
all
the
line
into
a
list
call
``
text
''
:
import
sy
file_nam
=
sys.argv
[
1
]
text
=

tri

thi
exampl
receiv
the
file
name
via
a
command
line
argument
.
So
make
sure
that
you
call
it
properli
:
let
's
assum
that
you
save
thi
program
as
``
exception_test.pi
''
.
In
thi
case
,
you
have
to
call
it
with
python
exception_test.pi
integers.txt
If
you
do
n't
want
thi
behaviour
,
just
chang
the
line
``
file_nam
=
sys.argv
[
1
]
''
to
``
file_nam
=
'integers.txt
'
''
.
the
previou
exampl
is
nearli
the
same
as
:
import
sy
file_nam
=
sys.argv
[
1
]
text
=
[
]
tri
:
fh
=
open
(
file_nam
,
'
r
'
)
except
ioerror
:
print
(
'
can
not
open
'
,
file_nam
)
els
:
text
=
fh.readlin
(
)
fh.close
(
)
if
text
:
print
(
text
[
100
]
)
the
main
differ
is
that
in
the
first
case
,
all
statement
of
the
tri
block
can
lead
to
the
same
error
messag
``
can
not
open
...
''
,
which
is
wrong
,
if
fh.close
(
)
or
fh.readlin
(
)
rais
an
error
.
